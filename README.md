## Amazon Fine Food Review
This file contains sentiment analysis for the Amazon fine good review dataset.

File includes following: Importing Libraries, Loading Dataset, Exploring Dataset, Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Vizualization, Data Pre-processing, VADER Model, Business Insights using PATTERN Model and Using TEXTBLOB and Conclusion

### Conclusion
We have highest number of positive sentiments for this product/service. So, we can say that this product/service is doing great in the market. We have also observed that this product/service is having very less negative sentiments as compare to their positive ones which shows that the market is BOOM for them.

## Hourly Enery Consumption of Dominion Virginia Power
This file contains LSTM Model for the Hourly Energy Consumption dataset.

### Dataset Information
PJM Interconnection LLC (PJM) is a regional transmission organization (RTO) in the United States. It is part of the Eastern Interconnection grid operating an electric transmission system serving all or parts of Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia.

File includes following: Importing Libraries, Loading Dataset, Normalizing Data, Exploring Dataset, Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Vizualization, Data Pre-processing, Preparing data for training the RNN models, Building a SIMPLE RNN model, Building an LSTM model, Comparing predictions made by simple RNN, LSTM model by plotting data in a single graph and Conclusion

### Conslusion
R^2 score for simple RNN model is 0.945 and for LSTM model is 0.956. As best possible R^2 score is 1.0 which is considered as best prediction and a score of 0.0 is considered as imperfect prediction therefore, it can be concluded that R^2 score of LSTM model is slightly better than that of simple RNN model.
